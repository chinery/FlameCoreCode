%	val is a (N x 1) matrix of eigenvalues, sorted in descending order.
%	method is a string: one of
%		'keepN' - to keep a fixed number of the eignvectors
%		'keepf' - to keep a specific fraction of the eigenenery;
%		'keept' - to keep all eigenvectors above a threshold
%		'keepr' - to keep a specific fraction of the number of evals.
%	param is a parameter, assumed to have a value appropriate to
%		the method chosen.
% post:
%	n - the number to keep
% notes:
%  For keepN method, the n returned is the minimum of param and the number
%  of eigenvalues.
