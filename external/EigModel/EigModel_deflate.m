function m2 = EigModel_deflate( m1, method, param )

% m2 = EigModel_deflate( m1, method, param )
% Deflate the EigModel m1 using the specified method, to yield m2.
% pre:
%	val is a (N x 1) matrix of eigenvalues, sorted in descending order.
%	method is a string: one of
%		'keepN' - to keep a fixed number of the eignvectors
%		'keepf' - to keep a specific fraction of the eigenenery;
%		'keept' - to keep all eigenvectors above a threshold
%		'keepr' - to keep a specific fraction of the number of evals.
%	param is a parameter, assumed to have a value appropriate to
%		the method chosen.
